# History

The very first version of this website was my former blog on MyOpera (my.opera.com/riduan91). The blog was composed of articles and poems I wrote in 2008-2013. During that period, Tang poetry and classical Vietnamese poems inspired me considerably. I loved to express my feelings through 7-syllable, 8-syllable verses or short free paragraphs. Those poems and articles formed the first part of today's website.

I migrated my blog to WordPress in 2015 following MyOpera's decommissioning. Wordpress is an ideal platform for literature articles and poems and can be adjusted to display correctly scientific articles. During 2014-2015, I made several lecture notes for my courses in the engineering program at Ecole Polytechnique (e.g., Advanced Algorithms) as well as the Data Science Master Program co-organized by Ecole Polytechnique and Telecom ParisTech. Since then, lecture notes have formed the second part of this website.

Since 2016, I have been fond of building simple web applications: some interactive games organized for a group of remote people, some applications for Dong-Hanh association, task and budget management for personal purposes. Several classical and modern technologies are used: PHP, Java, Python or (node)js as the back-end language; JS as the front-end; XAMPP, Tomcat or Angular as the platform. Those applications do not comply with Wordpress evidently. They were then hosted by a separated server provided by Amazon Web Service, then by OVH.

In 2018, I started giving courses for my friends who are researchers in pure science and who are interested in Data Science. My first courses were given under iPython notebooks' format.

I want, after all, centralize all of the resources described above: free and scientific articles, course materials and applications to a single "house", which is the objective of the current website.
